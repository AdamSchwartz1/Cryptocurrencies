# Cryptocurrencies

## Summary of Project
The purpose of this project was to help senior management analyze cryptocurrencies and put together an investment portfolio for its customers. I had to clean the data so it was usable for machine learning techniques. I then used PCA to reduce the model to three principal components and created an elbow chart to identify the amount of clusters to group the cryptocurrencies in to. Next, I ran a k-means algorithm to predict the k clusters. Finally, I created a 3D and 2D scatter plot and a table using hvplot to display the final data.

Please view crypto_clustering.ipynb for the complete analysis.

Applications used: Python, pandas, hvplot, sklearn, jupyter notebook, and git.
